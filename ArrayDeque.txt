In Java, ArrayDeque is a resizable array-based implementation of the Deque interface that allows efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
It can be used as a stack (LIFO) or a queue (FIFO), is faster than LinkedList for most operations, but is not thread-safe


🔹 What is ArrayDeque?
Definition: A double-ended queue (deque) implemented using a resizable array.
Package: java.util
Key Feature: Supports adding/removing elements at both ends in O(1) time.
Declaration Example:
ArrayDeque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

🔹 Core Characteristics
Resizable: Grows dynamically as needed; no fixed capacity limit.
Nulls not allowed: You cannot store null elements.
Not thread-safe: Requires external synchronization for concurrent use.
Performance:
=Faster than LinkedList for queue operations (cache-friendly).
=Faster than Stack when used as a stack



🔹 Common Operations
=====================
Operation	          Method	                                  Description
Add at front	      addFirst(e) / offerFirst(e)	          Inserts element at head
Add at end	          addLast(e) / offerLast(e)               Inserts element at tail
Remove from front	  removeFirst() / pollFirst()	          Removes head element
Remove from end	      removeLast() / pollLast()	              Removes tail element
Peek front	          peekFirst()	                          Retrieves head without removing
Peek end	          peekLast()	                          Retrieves tail without removing

import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayDeque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

        // Add elements
        deque.addFirst("A");
        deque.addLast("B");
        deque.addLast("C");

        // Remove elements
        System.out.println(deque.removeFirst()); // A
        System.out.println(deque.removeLast());  // C

        // Peek
        System.out.println(deque.peekFirst());   // B
    }
}


🔹 When to Use ArrayDeque
✅ As a stack (instead of Stack class).
✅ As a queue (instead of LinkedList).
❌ Avoid when you need thread safety → use ConcurrentLinkedDeque instead.
❌ Avoid storing null values.




⚠️ Limitations & Risks
Not thread-safe: Must wrap with synchronization if used in multithreaded environments.
No nulls: Attempting to insert null throws NullPointerException.
Capacity growth: Though dynamic, resizing may cause temporary overhead.


In short:
ArrayDeque is a high-performance, flexible alternative to Stack and LinkedList for implementing stacks and queues in Java.
It’s ideal for single-threaded scenarios where speed and simplicity matter
